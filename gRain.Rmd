First install packages from bioconductor:
```
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("graph","RBGL","Rgraphviz"))
```
then install "*gBase*", "*gRain*" and "*gRim*.
```
install.packages("gBase")
install.packages("gRain")
install.packages("gRim")
```
*Clinic example of Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter (1988)*
        
    “Shortness–of–breath (dyspnoea) may be due to tuberculosis, lung cancer or
    bronchitis, or none of them, or more than one of them. A recent visit to Asia
    increases the chances of tuberculosis, while smoking is known to be a risk factor
    for both lung cancer and bronchitis. The results of a single chest X–ray do not
    discriminate between lung cancer and tuberculosis, as neither does the presence
    or absence of dyspnoea.”

1. Specify conditional probability tables (with values as given in Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter
(1988)):
```{r, message=FALSE}
library("gRain")
yn <- c("yes", "no")
a <- cptable(~ asia, values = c(1, 99), levels = yn)
t.a <- cptable(~ tub + asia, values = c(5, 95, 1, 99), levels = yn)
s <- cptable(~ smoke, values = c(5,5), levels = yn)
l.s <- cptable(~lung|smoke, values=c(1,9,1,99), levels=yn)
b.s <- cptable(~bronc|smoke, values=c(6,4,3,7), levels=yn)
e.lt <- cptable(~either|lung:tub,values=c(1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1),levels=yn)
x.e <- cptable(~xray|either, values=c(98,2,5,95), levels=yn)
d.be <- cptable(~dysp|bronc:either, values=c(9,1,7,3,8,2,1,9), levels=yn)
```
2. Compile list of conditional probability tables and create the network:</br>
    A network is created with the function *grain()* which returns an object of class
grain. </br>
The *compileCPT()* function does some checking of the specified CPT’s. (For example, it is checked that the graph defined by the CPT’s is acyclic. Furthermore, the
specification of *t.a* gives a table with four entries and the variable tub is specified
to be binary. Hence it is checked that the variable asia is also binary.) The object
plist is a list of arrays and it is from this list that the grain object is created.</br>
Compilation of a grain object based on CPTs involves the following steps: First it
is checked whether the list of CPTs defines a directed acyclic graph (a DAG). If so,
then the DAG is created; it is moralized and triangulated to form a chordal (triangu-
lated) graph. The CPTs are transformed into clique potentials defined on the cliques
of this chordal graph. The chordal graph together with the corresponding clique po-
tentials are the most essential components of a grain object, and one may indeed
construct a grain object directly from a specification of these two components.
```{r}
plist <- compileCPT(list(a, t.a, s, l.s, b.s, e.lt, x.e, d.be))
plist
plist$asia
plist$tub
net1 <- grain(plist)
net1
```
*propagate* If TRUE the network is also propagated meaning that the cliques of the junction tree are calibrated to each other.

3. The network can be queried to give marginal probabilities:
```{r}
querygrain(net1, nodes=c("lung","bronc"), type="marginal")
```
4. Likewise, a joint distribution can be obtained:
```{r}
querygrain(net1,nodes=c("lung","bronc"), type="joint")
```
5. Evidence can be entered in following forms:
```{r}
net12 <- setEvidence(net1, nodes=c("asia", "dysp"), states=c("yes", "yes"))
pEvidence( net12 )
```
we can verify this by computing the marginal distribution: <br/>
$\begin{align}
p(A,D) = \sum p(A,D|T,S,L,E,B,X) & = \sum p(A)p(D|E,B) \\
& = p(A=yes)[p(D=yes|E=y,B=y)+p(D=yes|E=y,B=n) \\ 
& \qquad \qquad +p(D=yes|E=n,B=n)+p(D=n|E=y,B=n)]
\end{align}$

6. The network can be queried again:
```{r}
querygrain(net12, nodes=c("lung","bronc"), type="marginal")
```

7. Building network from data </br>
    *chestSim500* </br>
    Description: Simulated data from the Chest Clinic example (also known as the Asia example) from Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988.
    
```{r}
library(gRbase)
data(chestSim500, package='gRbase')
str(chestSim500)
head(chestSim500)
g<-list(~asia, ~tub | asia, ~smoke, ~lung | smoke, ~bronc | smoke,
        ~either | lung : tub, ~xray | either, ~dysp | bronc : either)
chestdag<-dagList(g)
simdagchest <- grain(chestdag, data=chestSim500)
simdagchest <- compile(simdagchest, propagate=TRUE, smooth=.1)
querygrain(simdagchest, nodes =c("lung","bronc"),type="marginal")
```

8. Exercise </br>
  + Inference: Using the network built in 7 and given the data of a patient that *asia=yes* and *dysp=yes*, what is the probablity of this patient getting *either* *tub* or *lung*, and what is the probablity of getting *bronc=yes*?
  + If you have extra time left, verify the result in 5. 
  + If you still have time left, you can go through this genetics examples: https://www.r-bloggers.com/grain-genetics-example/.
  
### Issue of high dimensionality

We compute joint distribution $p(V)$ by multiplying all the CPTs:<br/>
<center>$\begin{equation}
p(V) = p(a)p(t|a)p(s)p(l|s)p(b|s)p(e|t, l)p(d|e, b)p(x|e)
\end{equation}$,</center> 

this could give us a huge number of CPTs for larger variables each with more states, e.g. 80 variables with 10 states would have $10^{80}$ CPTs. However, gRain still works with 80 nodes in a genetics network.<br/>
The solution is to *NOT* calcualte the join distribution but perform local computation and send messages between them.
